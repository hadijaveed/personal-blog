# My desk setup in 2024

My desk setup as of writing this post. I've been working from home for the past 1 year and have been slowly evolving my setup to be more ergonomic and efficient.

Also, I want to use this blog to track changes for my setup over time and share with fellow devs / team-mates.

## Things I optimized for:
- Minimalism: More stuff means more clutter. It's harder to clean and I am lazy.
- A setup I cannot make messy
- Ergonomics: I had neck and back problems with a two-monitor setup. I optimized for a viewing and sitting angle that gives me comfort.
- Standing desk: Honestly, I cannot do heads-down work while standing. But it's good to stand from time to time, and take calls while standing.
- A good keyboard and mouse that are ergonomic, durable, and give me good tactile feedback.
- Affordability: Something that doesn't cost me a lot and make my wife angry. I did a DIY desk to keep it cheap.
- Cable management: I wanted to live a single cable life if possible.

## Desk Setup

To give a minimal look, I tried to keep the setup black and white, mostly white to maximize the amount of light coming from the windows.

### Desk
I DIYed my desk to avoid paying crazy money while having a durable setup, and something I could change over time.

- [TOPSKY electric motor legs](https://www.amazon.com/TOPSKY-Electric-Adjustable-Standing-Computer/dp/B08T247N3N?th=1){:target="_blank"}: I can adjust the length of the tabletop to my liking, but Boston apartment space is limited. Can also use a butcher block top in the future.
- [Ikea Table Top](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/linnmon-tabletop-white-00251135/){:target="_blank"}: $20 tabletop. 
- [Under desk cable management tray](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B8ZYPJ7L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1){:target="_blank"}: Where I can hide my cables. Also gives me the ability to move my desk around. I wanted to live a single cable life if possible.
- [Cable clips](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BL6S5VZY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1){:target="_blank"} for two USB-C ports on the desk, one for the laptop and other for charging.
- [Orbit desk mat](https://www.amazon.com/Orbitkey-Recycled-Document-Hideaway-Magnetic/dp/B08T21ZJDY?th=1){:target="_blank"} given to me by a good friend, so technically free for me.
- [Wooden vertical laptop stand](https://www.amazon.com/HumanCentric-Vertical-Adjustable-MacBook-Surface/dp/B08RSK2PPH){:target="_blank"}: I never open up my laptop once it's on the desk.

### Desk Chair
I have an ergonomic chair from [Autonomous](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair){:target="_blank"} that I bought in 2020 for 400 bucks.

### Monitor
I used to be a two-monitor guy. I started feeling subtle pain in my neck due to the angle and tilt of the monitors. It was unnoticeable at first. I switched to one giant curved monitor where my viewing angle is more natural and centered, and all the pain went away.

#### [LG 38-inch curved monitor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09V6S4ML2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1){:target="_blank"}. I cannot recommend this monitor enough. It's a game-changer.

- This monitor comes with an excellent ergonomic stand that can be adjusted in multiple directions. I've tried many ergonomic arms, but the quality is never good. LG makes one of the best solid ergo stands. The black color monitor stand on the white desk gives a good contrast too.
- This monitor also helped with my cable management. I have one USB-C cable that comes out of the monitor to my laptop. Laptop charging is built into the monitor. My camera, mic, and other lights are hooked to the monitor too. I can't stop recommending this monitor.

### Lights attached to monitor
I wanted to have an aesthetically pleasing light setup, while having good utility too.
- [LED strip](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08X1QMRKK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1){:target="_blank"} on the back of the monitor, plugged into the monitor too.
- For reading or whenever I need light (very rare though), I use [BenQ ScreenBar Halo](https://www.amazon.com/BenQ-ScreenBar-Halo-Controller-Temperature/dp/B08WT889V3){:target="_blank"}. The temperature and light controls are very good. Not sure if I recommend it for the price. I got it as a gift.

### Keyboard(s)

I use [Logitech MX Mechanical keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Mechanical-Illuminated-Low-Profile-Performance/dp/B09LK63PKB){:target="_blank"}. This keyboard is excellent. While it gives you excellent tactile feedback, unlike other mechanical keyboards, the build quality is excellent. Logitech software and the battery life are excellent too. Bluetooth lag and wireless connectivity are top-notch.

Keyboards that are expensive and I don't use day-to-day (displayed on the wall to give a feel to the room, got them for fun and aesthetically pleasing sounds, less utility):

- [Anne Pro 2](https://www.amazon.com/Anne-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Backlit/dp/B07VY9C3PN){:target="_blank"}: Cute 60% keyboard. Less utility.
- [Keychron C1 Tenkeyless](https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Hot-swappable-Mechanical-Double-Shot-Tenkeyless/dp/B08CNB33R4?th=1){:target="_blank"}: Cute too, but elevated for me. Gave me wrist pain.

### Mouse
I use [Logitech MX Master 3S](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-MX-Master-3S-Graphite/dp/B09HM94VDS){:target="_blank"}. I like the scroll wheel and the build quality. I highly recommend it. Bluetooth lag and the build quality are excellent.

### Mic Setup
I wanted a mic with good sound quality, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of setting it up. I use the [Blue Yeti X](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Microphone-Recording-Podcasting-Adjustable/dp/B08F82B7LJ){:target="_blank"}, which is plug-and-play.

### Camera
I wanted a good quality camera but didn't want to go through the hassle of setting it up. I use this [Anker PowerConf C300](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09MFMTMPD){:target="_blank"}.

That's it, folks! More changes to come...
