# About Me

I've a decade long experience in software development. As CTO/Co-Founder of [Vincere Health](https://www.vincere.health/) (acquired by Red Ventures Optum in 2023), I developed a behavior change platform integrating financial incentives with AI, now adopted by industry leaders like United Health Care, MSK, and Mayo Clinic. I independently developed Quitbuddy an early AI model grounded in evidence-backed content for smoking and vaping cessation. Quitbuddy achieved industry-leading engagement and behavior change metrics, addressing health equity and enhancing care quality through accessible technology. Previously, I was part of CapitalOne's telephony team, contributing to the development of a voice-enabled NLP chatbot for IVR systems.

I collaborate with founders and business stakeholders to boost R&D for tech-centric companies. I guide non-tech founders on product development, tech narratives for fundraising, AI/ML applications, build vs. buy choices, security enhancements, and team augmentation.
