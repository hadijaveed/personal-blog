# About Me

With over a decade of experience in software development, I've had the privilege of working on diverse and impactful projects. As the CTO and Co-Founder of [Vincere Health](https://www.vincere.health/) (acquired by Red Ventures Optum in 2023), I led the development of a behavior change platform for patients struggling with addiction which seamlessly integrates [fintech solution to reward users](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/helping-people-quit-smoking-through-financial-rewards/){:target="_blank"} with financial incentives for quitting, alongside an AI-powered chatbot that drives behavior change.

Earlier, I worked at Capital One, contributing to the development of voice-enabled NLP chatbots for IVR systems as part of their telephony innovation team.

Currently, I serve as CTO and Co-Founder of [RevelAI Health](https://revelaihealth.com/){:target="_blank"}, where we’re using generative AI to transform orthopedic care—streamlining recovery journeys and improving clinical outcomes through intelligent automation.

In the post-ChatGPT era, I also launched Prodify, a boutique AI product studio focused on strategic consulting, rapid prototyping, and compliance support. We've partnered with fast-growing startups across healthcare and adjacent sectors, built a 10-person engineering team, scaled to 7-figure revenue, and helped founders bring GenAI ideas to life. While I now serve in an advisory capacity, my partner leads engineering and day-to-day operations at Prodify.
