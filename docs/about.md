# About Me
I've a decade long experience in software development. As CTO/Co-Founder of [Vincere Health](https://www.vincere.health/) (acquired by Red Ventures Optum in 2023), I developed a behavior change platform integrating financial incentives with AI, now adopted by industry leaders like United Health Care, MSK, and Mayo Clinic. I independently developed Quitbuddy an early AI model grounded in evidence-backed content for smoking and vaping cessation. Quitbuddy achieved industry-leading engagement and behavior change metrics, addressing health equity and enhancing care quality through accessible technology. Previously, I was part of CapitalOne's telephony team, contributing to the development of a voice-enabled NLP chatbot for IVR systems.

While founding new ventures remains a passion, recognizing the potential in the post-ChatGPT era I'm currently enjoying the dynamic world of consulting, leveraging my expertise to drive innovation across industries and working with founders / business stakeholders. I am leading a boutique AI studio that specializes in following:

- Strategic consulting for AI integration and fundraising narratives
- Rapid prototyping and large-scale application development with AI
- LLM optimization in production and UX design
- Giving access to vast network of talented engineers and designers
- Build vs buy decisions
- Helping companies get over security hurdles (HIPAA, SOC2 and HITRUST)
