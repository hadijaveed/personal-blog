# About Me

With over a decade of experience in software development, I've had the privilege of working on diverse and impactful projects. As the CTO and Co-Founder of [Vincere Health](https://www.vincere.health/) (acquired by Red Ventures Optum in 2023), I led the development of a behavior change platform for patients struggling with addiction which seamlessly integrates [fintech solution to reward users](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/helping-people-quit-smoking-through-financial-rewards/) with financial incentives for quitting, alongside an AI-powered chatbot that drives behavior change.

Previously, I was part of CapitalOne's telephony team, contributing to the development of a voice-enabled NLP chatbot for IVR systems.

My entrepreneurial drive continues (currently working on a stealth startup). Embracing the post-ChatGPT era and leveraging my applied AI experience, I'm now enjoying the dynamic world of consulting, where I leverage my expertise to drive innovation across industries, working closely with founders and business stakeholders.

I currently lead a boutique AI studio offering:

- Strategic AI integration consulting
- Rapid prototyping or productionizing AI systems, including optimization and UX guidance
- Access to a network of skilled engineers and designers
- Guidance on build vs. buy decisions
- Support in navigating security compliance (HIPAA, SOC2, HITRUST)
