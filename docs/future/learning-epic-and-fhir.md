# Journey of learning integrations with Epic and FHIR

In past I've used middlewares like Redox and Xealth to connect custom developed health-care applications. I decided to learn how to connect to Epic and FHIR directly and document my journey here.

Just like there are so many developers out there, who have no idea how to connect to Epic, learn FHIR and get up-to speed with the integration. I hope this blog serve as a purpose.

## Medplum

[Medplum has excellent documentation about FHIR](https://www.medplum.com/docs/fhir-basics){:target="_blank"}, it can get you up-to speed with FHIR quickly. Listening to [interoperability guides](https://www.medplum.com/products/integration){:target="_blank"} from Medplum. Excellent resource. Shout out to the medplum team.

## Next Steps

- Go sign-up into [Fhir Developer](https://fhir.epic.com/Developerl){:target="_blank"} and create an account.
- Learn about Epic's open endpoints for testing [here](https://open.epic.com/MyApps/Endpoints){:target="_blank"}.
- Select [developer](https://open.epic.com/Home/InteroperabilityGuide){:target="_blank"} on this page to access different resources.
- Medplum resource to learn: [Medplum Github Resource](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/tree/main/examples/medplum-demo-bots/src/epic){:target="_blank"}.
