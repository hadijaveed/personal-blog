<high-level-theme>
How AI made me productive since the LLM area. how I can use LLM's for monotonous tasks like basic JSON data passing, REST APIs, basic SQL, designing tables to engineering tasks.

- make sure to use my original tone of the writing
- everything should be in the markdown format with title starting as heading 1 and subsequent headings as heading 2 and others
- come up with a good title first
- build a good engaging outline of the blog
- give clear good examples of things AI have automated for me
- give examples of things I can focus more
- an advise piece to the engineers on how they should follow the bigger picture more
- show humility in the writing, by no means AI is perfect or the AI is accurate. following are just my personal opinions and how I have used AI to my personal advantage
